# Linear Regression Project Overview

## Introduction to Linear Regression
Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that predicts numerical values using input characteristics. It presupposes a linear relationship between the features and the goal variable. The model learns the coefficients that best suit the data and can predict future inputs.

## Detailed Explanation of Linear Regression
Linear Regression involves fitting a linear equation to observed data. The simplest form is the linear relationship between two variables, known as simple linear regression. For more than one independent variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.

### Key Concepts
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves more than one independent variable.
- **Coefficient and Intercept**: The slope and intercept of the regression line.

## Implementing Linear Regression
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather and preprocess your data.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose between simple or multiple linear regression based on your data.
3. **Training the Model**: Use the linear regression algorithm to train your model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using suitable metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics for Linear Regression
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The mean of the absolute values of the errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The mean of the squared errors.
- **Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²)**: Measures how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model.

## Getting Started with Linear Regression
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of statistics and Python programming.
- **Libraries and Tools**: Familiarity with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- **Experimentation**: Test the model on different datasets to understand its behavior.
