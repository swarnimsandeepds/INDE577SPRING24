# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project Overview

## Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors
The K-NN algorithm assumes a resemblance between the new case/data and the existing cases and assigns the new case to the category that is most similar to the extant categories.
The K-NN algorithm maintains all available data and classifies new data points based on their similarity. This means that when fresh data comes, it may be quickly sorted into a suitable category using the K-NN method.
K-NN algorithms can be used for both regression and classification, however they are more commonly utilized for classification problems.
K-NN is a nonparametric algorithm, which means it makes no assumptions about the underlying data.
It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.
KNN algorithm at the training phase just stores the dataset and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much similar to the new data.

## Detailed Explanation of KNN
The KNN algorithm works as follows:
1. **Choose the number of K**: Select the number of nearest neighbors.
2. **Calculate Distance**: Compute the distance between the query point and all the available points.
3. **Sort the Distances**: Sort these distances and take the top K nearest neighbors from the sorted list.
4. **Vote for Labels**: For classification, the most frequent label of these neighbors is used as the label for the query point.

### Key Features of KNN
- **Non-parametric**: No assumptions about the shape of the data.
- **Versatility**: Can be used for both classification and regression.

## Implementing KNN
1. **Prepare Data**: Normalize your data and split it into training and testing sets.
2. **Choosing K**: Select an appropriate value for K.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute the distance between data points using a method like Euclidean distance.
4. **Model Training**: Fit the KNN algorithm to the training data.
5. **Model Prediction**: Predict the output for the testing data.

## Evaluation Metrics for KNN
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Useful for multi-class classification problems.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression problems, measures the average of the squares of the errors.

## Getting Started with KNN
- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python and basic machine learning concepts.
- **Libraries**: Utilize libraries like Scikit-learn for an easy implementation.
- **Experimentation**: Test with different values of K and distance metrics to see their effect on the results.
