Purpose: To perform Supervised & Unsupervised Learning using various machine learning models. 

The primary datasets used in this repository will be included in the `dataset` folder can be found [here](https://github.com/swarnimsandeepds/INDE577SPRING24/tree/5bdf24de48046d22584141d6dde660c5485d5d1e/DATASET).
The various algorithms are implemented using the RealEstate Dataset(predicting the price of a house based on features like  X1 transaction date	X2 house age	X3 distance to the nearest MRT station	X4 number of convenience stores	X5 latitude	X6 longitude. 
The other dataset used is a heart_failure_clinical_records dataset that predicts the mortality of a person based on features like, age, anaemia, creatinine_phosphokinase,diabetes, ejection_fraction, high_blood_pressure, platelets, serum_creatinine,serum_sodium,sex and smoking.
