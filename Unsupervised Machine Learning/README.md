# Unsupervised Learning Project Overview

## Introduction to Unsupervised Learning
As the name implies, unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised by a training dataset. Instead, models discover hidden patterns and insights in the given data. It can be compared to the learning process that occurs in the human brain when learning something new.

## Unpacking Unsupervised Learning
### Core Concepts
   - Unsupervised learning cannot be applied directly to a regression or classification problem since, unlike supervised learning, we just have input data and no output data.
   - The purpose of unsupervised learning is to identify the underlying structure of a dataset, categorize it based on similarities, and display it in a compressed fashion.
### Applications
   - Unsupervised learning is used in various applications like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.

## The Unsupervised Learning Approach
- **Data Preparation**: Involves collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing data.
- **Model Selection**: Choosing the right algorithm based on the task, like K-Means for clustering or PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- **Training**: Algorithms learn from data without any supervision.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics or visualizations.

## Steps to Implement Unsupervised Learning
1. **Gather Data**: Collect and preprocess your data.
2. **Choose a Model**: Select an appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm.
3. **Train the Model**: Let the algorithm process the data.
4. **Analyze Results**: Interpret the outcomes to extract insights.
5. **Iterate**: Refine the approach based on the results and repeat.

## Getting Started
- **Prerequisites**: Set up your environment with necessary libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.
- **Running Experiments**: Execute scripts to run unsupervised learning models on datasets.
- **Observing Outcomes**: Analyze the results to understand the patterns identified by the model.
