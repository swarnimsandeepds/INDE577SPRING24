# K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning technique in data analytics. This method organizes a dataset into K unique, non-overlapping groups (clusters) by examining their attributes. It assigns each data point to the cluster with the nearest centroid.

How K-Means Clustering Operates?

The K-Means algorithm enhances cluster quality through these steps:

Initialization: Select K centroids at random from the dataset.

Assignment: Link each data point to the nearest centroid.

Update: Recalculate each centroid by taking the average of all points assigned to that cluster.

This cycle continues until the centroids no longer move significantly, signaling that the clusters are optimally formed for the given parameters.

Characteristics of K-Means Clustering

Efficiency: It is known for being fast and low-cost computationally.

Simplicity: The algorithm is straightforward to implement and comprehend.


Implementing K-Means Clustering

Data Preparation: Normalize your data and select an appropriate number of clusters (K).

Algorithm Application: Implement the K-Means algorithm using tools like Scikit-learn or through a custom approach.

Analysis of Results: Examine and interpret the results within the context of your dataset.

Metrics for Evaluating K-Means:-

Several metrics can assess the effectiveness of K-Means clustering:

Inertia: Indicates the compactness of the clusters.

Silhouette Score: Assesses how well an object fits within its cluster relative to other clusters.

Davies-Bouldin Index: Desirable lower values suggest better separation between clusters.

Getting Started with K-Means Clustering:-

Prerequisites: Ensure you have essential Python packages installed, including NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

Executing the Algorithm: Run the clustering script to apply the K-Means algorithm to your data.

Visualization of Results: Employ graphical representations to display the clusters and their centroids, enhancing your understanding of the distribution.
