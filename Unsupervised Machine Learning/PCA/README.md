# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Project Overview

## Introduction to Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised learning approach used to reduce dimensionality in machine learning. It is a statistical procedure that, using orthogonal transformation, turns correlated feature observations into a set of linearly uncorrelated features. These newly altered traits are known as the Principal Components. It is one of the most used tools for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. It is a strategy for identifying strong patterns in a given dataset by decreasing variances.
In general, PCA seeks a lower-dimensional surface onto which to project high-dimensional data.

## Detailed Explanation of PCA
PCA involves the following steps:
1. **Standardization**: The data is standardized to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.
2. **Covariance Matrix Computation**: It captures the variance and covariance among variables.
3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Identifies the principal components that capture the most variance in the data.
4. **Projection**: Original data is projected onto a new set of orthogonal axes (principal components).

### Features of PCA
- **Data Visualization**: Helps in visualizing high-dimensional data.
- **Noise Reduction**: By keeping only significant components, noise in data can be reduced.
- **Feature Extraction**: Efficiently extracts the most important features from the dataset.

## How to Use PCA
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize or standardize your dataset.
2. **Apply PCA**: Use PCA to reduce dimensions of the data while preserving as much information as possible.
3. **Model Building**: Use the transformed dataset to build your machine learning models.

## Evaluation Metrics for PCA
- **Explained Variance**: Indicates the proportion of the dataset's variance that lies along each principal component.
- **Scree Plot**: A line plot of the eigenvalues which helps to decide the number of principal components to keep.

## Getting Started with PCA
- **Prerequisites**: Install Python libraries like NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
- **Implementation**: Apply PCA on your dataset using Python libraries.
- **Result Analysis**: Analyze the output to understand the impact of dimensionality reduction on your data.
